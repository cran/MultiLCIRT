Description: Framework for the Item Response Theory analysis of dichotomous and ordinal polytomous outcomes under the assumption of multidimensionality and discreteness of the latent traits. The fitting algorithms allow for missing responses and for different item parameterizations and are based on the Expectation-Maximization paradigm. Individual covariates affecting the class weights may be included in the new version (since 2.1).
