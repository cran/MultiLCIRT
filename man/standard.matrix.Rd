\title{Standardization of a matrix of support points on the basis of a vector of probabilities}
\description{Given a matrix of support points X and a corresponding vector of probabilities piv
it computes the mean for each dimension, the variance covariance matrix, the correlation matrix, 
Spearman correlation matrix, and the standarized matrix Y}
\usage{standard.matrix(X,piv)}

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
\item{X}{matrix of support points for the distribution included row by row}
\item{piv}{vector of probabilities with the same number of elements as the rows of \code{X}}
}

## Example of standardization of a distribution with randomly generated support points and probabilities
X = matrix(rnorm(100),20,5)
piv = runif(20); piv = piv/sum(piv)
out = standard.matrix(X,piv)
