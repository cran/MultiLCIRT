\title{Likelihood ratio testing between nested multidimensional LC IRT models}
\description{The function tests a certain multidimensional model (restricted model) 
against a larger multidimensional model based on a higher number of dimensions. A
typical example is testing a unidimensional model (and then the hypothesis of unidimensionality)
against a bidimensional model. Both models are estimated by \code{est_multi_poly}.}

\usage{test_dim(S, yv, k, link = 1, disc = 0, difl = 0, multi0 = 1:J, multi1, tol = 10^-10,
	            disp = FALSE)}

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{S}{matrix of all response sequences observed at least once in the sample and listed row-by-row
           (use 999 for missing response)}
  \item{yv}{vector of the frequencies of every response configuration in \code{S}}
  \item{k}{number of ability levels (or latent classes)}
  \item{link}{type of link function (1 = global logits, 2 = local logits);
            with global logits the Graded Response model
            results; with local logits the  Partial Credit results (with dichotomous responses, global logits
            is the same as using local logits resulting in the Rasch or the 2PL model depending on the value
            assigned to disc)}  \item{disc}{indicator of constraints on the discriminating indices 
            (0 = all equal to one, 1 = free)}
  \item{difl}{indicator of constraints on the difficulty levels (0 = free, 1 = rating scale parametrization)}
  \item{multi0}{matrix specifying the multidimensional structure of the restricted model}
  \item{multi1}{matrix specifying the multidimensional structure of the larger model}
  \item{tol}{tolerance level for checking convergence of the algorithm as relative difference between 
  	         consecutive log-likelihoods}
  \item{disp}{to display intermediate output}
